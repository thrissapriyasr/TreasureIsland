### Text Snippets from my example

* 'You\'re at a crossroad. Where do you want to go? Type "left" or "right"'
* 'You\'ve come to a lake. There is an island in the middle of the lake. Type "wait" to wait for a boat. Type "swim" to swim across.'
* "You arrive at the island unharmed. There is a house with 3 doors. One red, one yellow and one blue. Which colour do you choose?"
* "It's a room full of fire. Game Over."
* "You found the treasure! You Win!"
* "You enter a room of beasts. Game Over."
* "You chose a door that doesn't exist. Game Over."
* "You get attacked by an angry trout. Game Over."
* "You fell into a hole. Game Over."

### Technical Info:

The game uses Python's conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`) for decision-making and storytelling logic. It's designed to be case-insensitive for user inputs.
